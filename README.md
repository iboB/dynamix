> *IMPORTANT* v2 is here. It is a big change. The last v1 release was [v1.4.0](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

DynaMix (*Dynamic Mixins*) is an alternative take on object oriented programming and dynamic polymorphism. It lets users compose and modify polymorphic objects at run time. The main target language is C++, but C is also supported.

The library is a means to create a project's **architecture** rather than achieve its purpose. It helps with *extensibility*, *readability*, *scalability* and *interoperability*. It focuses on **maximal performance** and **minimal memory overhead**.

DynaMix is applicable for the software architecture of systems with complex objects including, but not limited to:

* Games (especially role-playing ones or strategies)
* CAD systems
* Enterprise systems

The library uses the type `dynamix::object` as a placeholder, whose instances can be extended with existing classes (mixins), thus providing a particular instance with the *mixin features* of all those types. Likely the most important types of *mixin features* are messages: functional objects which in C++-OOP terms can be thought of as methods. Mixin features are overridable and use late binding and singular dispatch. Unicasts and multicasts are possible.

Here is a small example of what code may look like using the library:

```c++
    // assuming my_objects.get_ally(0); is a way to get an ally to the
    // main character in a game
    dynamix::object& obj = my_objects.get_ally(0);

    // now let's make the object think some positive thoughts about the
    // main character

    think(obj); // C++ doesn't allow us to have obj.think().
                // DynaMix's messages are like standalone functions

    // composition
    mutate(obj, dynamix::add<flying_creature>());

    // object can now respond to fly()

    fly(obj); // ...instead of obj.fly()

    // mutation
    mutate(obj
        , dynamix::remove<ally>()
        , dynamix::add<enemy>()
    );

    think(obj); // the same object now thinks negative thoughts about the main
                // character, since it's no longer an ally, but an enemy
```

Here are some of the key features of the library:

* Compose objects from mixins at run time
* Physically separate interface and implementation
* Non-intrusive &ndash; mixins don't need to have a common parent or any special code inside
* Mutate "live" objects by changing their composition at run time
* Use `std::polymorphic_allocator` to allow fine-tuning allocations and achieving cache locality in critical parts of the code
* Create shared libraries and plugins which can enrich or modify objects, without modifying (or even rebuilding) the executable.
* Add "hotswap" to a project while developing
* Have complete runtime reflection by symbols or strings
* Messages:
    * Fast polymorphic calls &ndash; comparable to `std::function`
    * Have multicast messages, which are handled by many mixins within an object
    * Thread safe message calls &ndash; as thread safe as the underlying methods.

## Created with DynaMix

The following projects are known to use DynaMix as a key piece of their software architecture:

* [A3I](https://ibob.bg/blog/2022/01/25/what-we-do-at-viewray/) by ViewRay (Released 2022) - A medical system for cancer treatment. Uses v2
* [huse](https://github.com/iboB/huse) - a polymorphic serialization library. Uses v2
* [Heroes of the Dark](https://www.gameloft.com/game/heroes-of-the-dark) by Gameloft (Released 2021) - An RPG for Android, iOS, and Windows. Uses v1
* [War Planet Online: Global Conquest](http://warplanetonline.com/) by Gameloft (Released 2017) - An MMORTS for mobile devices and PCs. Uses v1
* [Blitz Brigade: Rival Tactics](http://www.rival-tactics.com/) by Gameloft (Released 2017) - A multiplayer RTS for Android, iOS, and Windows. Uses v1
* [Swords & Crossbones: An Epic Pirate Story](http://store.steampowered.com/app/383720/Swords__Crossbones_An_Epic_Pirate_Story/) by Epic Devs LLC (Released 2014) - A strategy/exploration game for Android, iOS, and PC. Uses v1
* [Earthrise](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730224855/http://play-earthrise.com/) by Masthead Studios (Released 2011) - An MMORPG (no longer supported). Uses an early proprietary prototype version of the library with a similar interface and a different implementation.

## V1

DynaMix v2 is a complete rewrite and though it has the same idea as v1, it is incompatible with it, and has a different interface, and different implementation for most features, and different terminology for some.

The last release of DynaMix v1 was [v1.4.0](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/releases/tag/v1.4.0). The documentation is available [here](https://ibob.bg/dynamix/v1/index.html)

A list of the most notable differences between v1 and v2 can be found [here](doc/misc/v2-vs-v1.md).

## Boost.Mixin

DynaMix was initially developed as [Boost.Mixin](https://github.com/iboB/boost.mixin) but is now a separate library that doesn't depend on the Boost libraries Collection.

Let's imagine a program that needs to create representations for various music

/*`
As you can see with respect to the type of media which is played, we could have those two
classes that share the interface `get_sound` and have some unique methods to
provide the media.

An approach, alternative to DynaMix here could have been to have a common
parent with a pure virtual method `get_sound`.

Now let's add the macros that will make our classes work as mixins and the macro
that will define the message, that they will implement.
*/

DYNAMIX_MESSAGE_0(string, get_sound);
DYNAMIX_DEFINE_MESSAGE(get_sound);

DYNAMIX_DECLARE_MIXIN(cd_reader);
DYNAMIX_DEFINE_MIXIN(cd_reader, get_sound_msg);

DYNAMIX_DECLARE_MIXIN(mp3_reader);
DYNAMIX_DEFINE_MIXIN(mp3_reader, get_sound_msg);

/*`
First, notice how we tell the library that the mixin implements the interface (or message)
`get_sound`. We need to add the suffix `_msg` when we refer to the message like this.

Second, although we declare and define the messages and mixins on consecutive lines
here, this is not a requirement. Normally you'd want to have the declarations in
header files and the definitions in cpp files. See the more detailed Examples
section for an example about that.

Now let's define a new axis for our classes: the type of output they'll have:
*/

class headphones_output
{
public:
    void play();
};

class speakers_output
{
public:
    void play();
};

/*`
and then, again "tell" the library about the new message and mixins:
*/

DYNAMIX_MESSAGE_0(void, play);
DYNAMIX_DEFINE_MESSAGE(play);

DYNAMIX_DECLARE_MIXIN(headphones_output);
DYNAMIX_DEFINE_MIXIN(headphones_output, play_msg);

DYNAMIX_DECLARE_MIXIN(speakers_output);
DYNAMIX_DEFINE_MIXIN(speakers_output, play_msg);

//[basic_B
/*`
Now we're ready to create a simple object composed from our newly defined
mixins:
*/
    dynamix::object sound_player; // just an empty dynamix::object

    dynamix::mutate(sound_player)
        .add<cd_reader>()
        .add<headphones_output>();

/*`
Now we have an object, which has internally instantiated the mixin
classes. So let's start using it.

Since there is no polymorphic way of setting the music, we'll have to explicitly
get the appropriate mixin and set it like this:
*/
    sound_player.get<cd_reader>()->insert_cd("Led Zeppelin IV (1971)");

/*`
However playing music *is* a polymorphic operation and via the message `play` it
can be done in this simple manner:
*/
    play(sound_player);

/*`
This is the way to call DynaMix messages. They are nothing more than global
functions defined by the `DYNAMIX_MESSAGE` macros. Internally they will find
the appropriate class instance and call the appropriate message (or trigger a
run-time error if this cannot be done).

Something else that we can do with our object is make a live mutation of its
type via the `mutate` class. And change the playing behavior.
*/

    dynamix::mutate(sound_player)
        .remove<headphones_output>()
        .add<speakers_output>();

    play(sound_player);

/*`
The music is now being played through speakers instead of headphones.

Naturally we could also mutate the object by changing the media provider part:
*/

    dynamix::mutate(sound_player)
        .remove<cd_reader>()
        .add<mp3_reader>();

    sound_player.get<mp3_reader>()->copy_mp3("Led Zeppelin - Black Dog.mp3");

    play(sound_player);

/*`
And have "Black Dog" played through the existing mixin `speakers_output`.

Compared to a classic approach to a similar problem -- multiple inheritance -- this
saves us a lot of classes; in this case four for all the combinations of types
of media and types of speakers, which might not sound like much, but keep in
mind that the library is appropriate for big systems, that may have hundreds or
even thousands of possible combinations.

/*`

The last thing we'll cover in this basic example is how the speakers-specific
players "know" what sound to play. Remember the message we defined earlier, that
was supposed to be used to retrieve the sound from the media-specific players --
`get_sound`. It wasn't used before, but it is used by the speakers to obtain the
sound polymorphically.

All mixins may use a special macro that refers to their owning object --
`dm_this`.
Thus the following (pseudo) methods are possible:
*/

void headphones_output::play()
{
    cout << "playing " << get_sound(dm_this)
        << " through headphones" << endl;
}

void speakers_output::play()
{
    cout << "PLAYING " << get_sound(dm_this)
        << " THROUGH SPEAKERS" << endl;
}

And this covers the most basic usage of DynaMix.

/*! \page examples Examples

[TOC]

The examples given with the library are programs composed of multiple files and
modules that provide a deeper illustration of how the library is supposed to be
used, as opposed to the tutorials, which are single stand-alone files that
illustrate concrete library features focusing on functionality and not on
structure.

Hello World {#example_hello}
===========

The "Hello World" example is a very simple program with a single source file,
which shows a usage of the very core library functionality. It is a no means an
example of architecture.

Basic {#example_basic}
=====

The "Basic" example illustrates most of the library's features, but it mainly
gives an idea of a sample project file structure.

Includes {#basic_inc}
---------

### Mixins

There are several files named `*_mixin.hpp`. They have a single line in them
which declares that a class is a mixin.

They are *all* you need to include in order to use these mixins to mutate
objects. The users are encouraged to implement a similar structure in their own
applications. It allows us to modify the mixin classes, without having to
recompile anything but the compilation units that define the actual classes.

In most cases a C++ class is split between two files. A header for the
declaration to be included in compilation units that use the class, and a
compilation unit with the class definition. The mixin classes in the example
are similarly split. *However*, you may notice that the only place the header
files that declare a mixin class are included is in their corresponding
compilation units. In fact, your mixins that are like the ones in the example and
are never used with `object::get` as actual C++ classes, *don't need header
files at all*. You may simply write them in their compilation units only, much
like Java or C# classes are written.

### Messages

There are also several header files, named `*_messages.hpp` and their
corresponding `*_messages.cpp` compilation units.

They are used to declare and define messages. The messages in a file are grouped
by some common factor.

You need to include such files (and only them) if you want to call messages for
and object. The code that calls the messages is completely oblivious to what
mixins might actually implement them. You may add or remove mixins from your
project and all your code that only calls messages, won't need to be recompiled.

The users are encouraged to separate any messages they create in a similar
fashion.

Code {#basic_code}
----

Even though some mixins in the project are named `*_renderer` they don't
actually do any graphical rendering. They are merely stub classes that are
used to show how a project may be structured and to give and idea of what and
when is being called.

Multi DLL {#multi_dll}
=========

The Multi DLL example is an example that shows how
multiple dynamic libraries can work together sharing mixins and messages.

It has four modules:

- **dynlib** - a C++ dynamic library, linked with all other modules that has a mixin
and some messages.
- **plugin** - a plugin-style dynamic library, which is not linked with the
executable and, as plugins in other applications, may or may not be present with
it. If it is present, the executable loads it, and calls its exported function,
which enriches an object with a custom plugin mixin.
- **executable** - the actual project executable that creates an object,
optionally gives it to the plugin for custom mutation and then calls some
messages.

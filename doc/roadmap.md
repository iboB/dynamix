# Roadmap

Here's a list of notable planned new features and updates for DynaMix

## Soon

* [New feature: Fact](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/45) - Facts are like static variables. Available for the type (no need for an object). Get-value only.
* [Allow object construction from a mutation](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/59)
* [Optimize type lookup and mutations](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/57)
* Demo: [multicast reduce/accumulate](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/49)
* Demo: [app](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/50) - several domains and idiomatic project structure
* Demo: [self-locking objects](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/54)
* Demo: [multiple dispatch](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix/issues/53)

## Not Soon

* Public case study: A demo project that better illustrates the library's functionalities in a "real life" scenario. Complete with a document which gives problems for motivation and their DynaMix solutions.
* Zig bindings and interface
* Demo: Lua integration
* Demo: JS and WASM integration

## Possibly Never, But Sounds Nice

* Lazy mixin registration
* Create a preprocessing tool (like Qt's moc) that can be used instead of the macros for mixin and feature definition
